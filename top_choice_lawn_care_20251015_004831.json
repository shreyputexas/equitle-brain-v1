They laugh loud and often while striving to provide the best service and operate efficiently. Our crew members are directly responsible for the high-quality work done in every yard we visit. We are proud to have such an experienced and hard-working crew. Without these guys we could never provide you and your family with the expert lawn and landscaping services all of Austin has come to expect from us. The Top Choice Story Top Choice Lawn Care was founded in 2005 with the customer in mind. Throughout the years, the team has refined our processes, services, and area of operations and we now provide lawn care, landscaping, and irrigation to the greater part of West Austin as far north as Steiner Ranch and as far south as Buda. We are proud to be local and we are proud to be from Texas. We are veteran-owned and operated. It would be an honor to serve you. Our team NolanGeneral Manager / The Guy that tries to be funny in the emails Nolan was born and raised in Austin. The son of a landscape entrepreneur, he has been around the business since he can remember. Nolan attended Texas A&M university where he graduated with a finance degree and spent many Saturdays disappointed by the football team. After college, Nolan joined the Marine Corps as a combat engineer officer and moved to Virginia. Over four years, he and his wife – Joanie – lived on both coasts, and he served one tour in Iraq, and had other adventures. Nolan and his lovely wife have four rambunctious kids. He enjoys a good book, a hard workout, a close game, and his kids’ laughs. GoldenOperations Manager / The Guy That Actually Makes This Place Run Golden hails from a suburb of Salt Lake City.  He is the son of a small-town Idaho farmer.  He graduated twice from Brigham Young University – once as an undergraduate and once as a graduate.  For most of his professional career, he has been involved in sales and service management – overseeing sales professionals, service representatives, underwriters, and even technology resources.  He is our protocol and procedures guru.  Organizing and arranging materials, installations, safety processes – you name it.  In 2011, he moved to Austin to get his wife closer to home.  Shortly after arriving, he joined Top Choice and has loved being here.  Enough to become part owner! Golden is married to a perfect woman, has three girls and one boy and a couple of small dogs. JustinOperations / Fire Lord (He Puts Out Fire) Justin makes the trains run on time and does most of our nuts-and-bolts scheduling day to day. (So, if you’re ever annoyed at our scheduling, Justin’s direct phone line is…oh, wait…never mind…oops). When he isn’t arranging huge mulch deliveries or tracking down an exotic plant for your property, Justin also recruits, hires, trains, manages, coaches, etc – all our team. Justin was born and raised in Mexico and speaks fluent Spanish. He later came to the States and graduated from Brigham Young University. Before joining Top Choice, Justin worked in foreign-visa-program recruitment in the Houston Oil & Gas industry. He is happy to be in the green industry now. Justin is always humming or singing or whistling something and is notorious for getting a tune stuck in his head. He has two boisterous sons that keep him busy! JoeKing of the Drive Through / Ops Maestro Joe has a background in the restaurant space. Before joining Top Choice, he ran multiple Chic-fil-a stores in town. When he got tired of Chicken Sandwiches, he decided to try his hand at the lawn and landscape industry where he uses his vast experience with customer service and system efficiencies to make us better every day. ScottIrrigation/ Drip and Drop Master Scott has taken our irrigation department to the next level. He has over a decade of experience in the industry - starting in the field digging ditches. Through the years, he has moved through the industry with residential, commercial, and municipal experience. He even worked for the City of Austin for a while. When he isn’t watering the world (with the utmost of water conservation) he can be found rollerblading (he is a master) or helping folks in his neighborhood. We feel so thankful to have him on our team - teaching, coaching, managing our irrigators, and serving our customers. VanessaThe Office Mom / Customer Service Manager Vanessa is a local *gasp*. They actually exist. And she is one of those locals that has actually done the “Cool Austin Stuff” for a long time. Example: she faithfully attended ACL for many years before it reached national acclaim. She is a wonderful mom to two – dare we say – extremely smart kids. (A random conversation with the 10-year-old may involve the role of the American bill of rights…no joke). And she fills the much-needed role of mother to the office. She is calming and keeps things in perspective (for us and the customer). She is a natural gatherer – each weekend we hear of a family event she has planned. But it trickles into the office to when she organizes a potluck or celebrates a birthday. She is a valued member of the customer service team and if you call, text or email the office, you will likely get the opportunity to chat with Vanessa before long. Our Service Team (Great Folks On The Phones) John Imee Myra Estimators (Landscaping Gurus) AllisonEstimator Extraordinaire / Horticulture Phenom Allison is originally from Dallas (Don’t hold it against her). When she was a kid she loved extreme sports (I actually saw 3 skate boards in her car the other day – how on earth could you ever ride 3?!) She attended Texas A&M where she studied Horticulture. She finds viticulture (wine making) very fascinating and actually had several offers with vineyards up in the northwest. Before Top Choice, she worked for a well known tree company in the DFW area. She is one of those weird people that actually walks around plant nurseries for fun – she really likes plants. We love her because she is spunky and isn’t afraid to tell you what she thinks. She genuinely cares that customers get great service and she couples that with her love for the green industry. She is a team player and a fantastic estimator. You may catch her in your yard doing an estimate, or on the phone when you have a question. She’s a “Jack of all trades”, or should I say “Jane”? Formally, she is a certified arborist, so feel free to direct your tree questions her way. See her recognized on ISA here. SteveThe Gray Fox / \"Been there done that\" / Estimating Legend Steve has been doing landscaping and lawn care in Texas for over 30 years – most of it in Austin. He has spent time at a number of companies around town and has even run his own high-end maintenance company for a number of years. He is quick with a story about his grandmother and her begonias – Spoiler: Steve would save them in burlap sacks through the winter. He is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. If you ever get the chance, have him walk you around your yard – you won’t regret the information or the storiesOn the weekend you will find Steve laughing on the golf course (probably in a bunker). He may be with his buddies or with his birdie prone son (his son is reeeaaallly good). He has been married to his wonderful wife for 20 years (she is obviously a saint). Steve and his bride will eventually retire to a fishing boat in Florida where his daughter is currently in college. We are blessed and grateful to have Steve on the team. LisaThe one and only “Lady Landscaping” Lisa joined the team in early 2024. But that wasn’t the beginning of her adventures in landscaping. For several years she owned and operated her own company - and did much of the work herself. Since then, she has been a super mom, an elementary teacher, a school librarian and a realtor. We are grateful to have another capable and strong-willed lady grace our team (and put Nolan in his place). Join the Top Choice Lawn Care team! We have the best employees in the city.
